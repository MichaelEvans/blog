Today I noticed something interesting about my blog: I'm now a verified author! What does that mean, you might ask? When one of the pages of my blog shows up in a Google search, it will look a little something like this: 

{% img center /images/2013/02/25/authorship.png 600 400 Google Authorship %}

Why might you want Google Authorship? 

* It helps distinguish your content from other search results.
* You might get more followers on Google+.

Would you like to get Authorship on Google? It's actually extremely easy. Just follow the following steps:

1. You need a Google+ profile with a profile picture of yourself.
2. On the profile editor of Google+, there is a "Contributor to" section; add your website here. 
3. Add a link like this: `<a href="[your profile URL]?rel=author">Google</a>` somewhere on your website.
4. You're done! You can validate what your site would look like as a search result with a tool found [here](http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets).

Keep in mind that Google doesn't *guarantee* to show author information in Google Web Search or Google News results.
