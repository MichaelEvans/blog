While looking through the Chromium bug tracker today, I stumbled upon an [interesting bug](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=167513). The interesting part I found was [a screenshot posted by one of the Chromium team members](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=167513#c18).

If you look closely, it looks like the Google+ Messenger icon on the bottom right corner of the dock. Is this finally the integration of G+ Messenger and the web that we've been waiting for since G+ Messenger was introduced? Maybe we'll find out in a few short weeks during [Google IO](http://michaelevans.org/blog/2013/03/14/google-io-2013-and-google-reader/) this year!
