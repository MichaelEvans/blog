Last night Microsoft unveiled Surface, its entry into the already crowded tablet arena. The name, you might be thinking, sounds awfully familiar. That's cause [it is](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PixelSense). Anyway, the hardware of this reincarnation is *not* a table, it's actually quite sleek.

It's thinner and lighter than an iPad, and has a built in kickstand. But here's the kicker, the "smart cover", doubles as a keyboard. Combine this with Microsoft Office, and I think you might have a competitor in the works. It has a stylus that can work even when your hand is on the screen, a USB port, and all the bells and whistles you'd want to see from a mobile machine.

Unfortunately, I can't end the article there. Despite the fact that Microsoft blew me away by revealing a hot tablet, they still might let us down anyway. They were unable to provide a concrete release date, pricing, or battery life. Those three factors could easily change this purchase from a must-have, to a don't-bother. 

And then there's the name. You'd **think** they'd call it Microsoft Surface/Surface Pro, or something along those lines. It's a popular [naming scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Macbook) used by a few [other companies](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/), and even in their own [product lines](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/compare). But alas, they went with the succinct "Surface for Windows 8 Pro." Rolls right off the tongue, right? 

All in all, I'm still impressed with what I saw yesterday. The form factor is good, and the potential is there. And when Microsoft takes the hardware and software into their own hands, the usually do a [good](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/) [job](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Kinect). Hopefully when it comes out in the fall, Microsoft won't let us down.
