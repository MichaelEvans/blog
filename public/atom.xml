    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So by now you&#8217;ve probably heard about the Nexus 7. We heard it was coming <a href="http://michaelevans.org/blog/2012/06/26/shots-from-outside-io-2012/">last week</a>, and now after using it for a few days, here&#8217;s what my review.</p>

<p><img src="http://michaelevans.org/images/2012/07/03/nexus.jpg" width="400" height="200" title="Nexus 7" ></p>

<p></p>

<p>As a backstory, you should know that prior to recieving the Nexus 7 at Google IO, I already owned a Motorola Xoom, a Samsung Galaxy 10.1 (from IO 2011), and an HP Touchpad. Surprising as it might seem for someone with all these gadgets, I actually don&#8217;t really <em>get</em> tablets. I have a laptop, and a smartphone, and there just really isn&#8217;t a whole lot of use for a tablet that I&#8217;ve found. I&#8217;ve tried them all, including the iPad, and I just haven&#8217;t found a way to fit it into the collection of things I use on a daily basis.</p>

<p>But, I don&#8217;t give up trying so easily. Nor has Google it seems, because slowly but surely, Google has finally put together a combination of software and hardware that is an absolute pleasure to use. Not only that, but at $200, it&#8217;s a steal compared to <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">other popular options</a>.</p>

<p>The best way to review the Nexus however, is by breaking it down into the two main components that it&#8217;s comprised of: software and hardware.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>The core of the Nexus 7 is Android 4.1, codenamed &#8220;Jelly Bean&#8221;. Jelly Bean was not a revolutionary update like its predessesor, Ice Cream Sandwich, but an evolutionary one, that included three three main changes, as well as some small ones. The main changes were &#8220;Project Butter&#8221;, Google Search, and Google Now.</p>

<h4>Project Butter</h4>

<p>Project Butter has probably made the most significant impact for me on the overall feel of Android. Prior to IO, my main complaint with Android was how occasionally laggy it was. However, in Jelly Bean, Google has smoothed out the experience with faster response to touch, animations, and even has the CPU ramp up faster as a response to touch events. Speaking of touch events, Google has apparently devised a way to predict where your fingers will be, and allows the system to respond more quickly as a result. The sum of these changes results in a much smoother feel to the entire operating system.</p>

<h4>Google Search</h4>

<p>Google&#8217;s new voice search is their strike back against Siri. Powered by Google&#8217;s Knowledge Graph, it can do a lot more than Apple&#8217;s offering.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://michaelevans.org/images/2012/07/03/voice.jpg" width="375" height="200" title="Voice Search Demo" ></p>

<p>The speech-to-text seems to be significantly more accurate than Apple&#8217;s, as well as much quicker. I imagine this is because Google has moved the speech-to-text engine onto the device, as this is another feature of the new keyboard (more on that below).</p>

<p>Instead of just listing off a whole bunch of things that I&#8217;ve tried, here&#8217;s a video from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHkhp6BwnGo">JLishere</a>, who has compiled 41 queries against knoweledge graph. He demonstrates the wide variety of what Knowledge Graph allows the device to respond to, like local queries, transit directions, and what seems to just be tidbits from Wikipedia.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s most interesting to me, however, is the preview of the possibile ability to access core hardware functions, like turning on and off Wifi or Bluetooth. Another interesting feature is how this new voice search seems to fit in well with another new platform feature: Google Now.</p>

<!-- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHkhp6BwnGo -->


<h4>Google Now</h4>

<p>Google Now is a new card based system introduced in the new version of Android. It tells you about the weather, traffic information, sports scores, and other tidbits of information you&#8217;re likely to look up during your day. It&#8217;s quite convenient to have information about an upcoming flight available without having to keep checking it, or traffic information regarding my daily commute delivered right to my handset or tablet. Right now the number of available &#8216;cards&#8217; is limited, but as the number of uses expands, the functionality will continue to grow.</p>

<h4>Other features</h4>

<p>In addition to the fancy speech-to-text features, as well as the speed improvements, Google as added rich notifications that allow you to perform actions without opening the app. You can control the music player, or reply to a SMS message, all from the notification tray. Another addition is a new keyboard, which does text prediction. If you&#8217;ve ever used Swiftkey, you&#8217;ll feel right at home with the new stock keyboard. Also included is the offline speech-to-text engine, which allows for speedy transcription, if you&#8217;re into that.</p>

<p>Other changes include some fancy new camera and gallery improvements, and now Chrome is the standard browser. Combined with tab sync from other machines, this is the best mobile browsing experience I&#8217;ve had so far.</p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>

<p>At 340 grams (compared to the Kindle Fireâ€™s 413 grams), the Nexus 7 feels extremely light. It measures 10.45mm thick, which is just shy of the thickness of the Kindle Fire. The front of the tablet is an IPS 7-inch 1280 x 800 display, which is powered by an NVIDIA Tegra 3 quad-core processor, with 12 GPU cores, and 1GB of RAM. As for storage, it comes in 8GB ($199) and 16GB ($249) capacities.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://michaelevans.org/images/2012/07/03/chrome.jpg" width="375" height="200" title="Chrome" ></p>

<p>In addition to that serious computing power, the Nexus 7 has plenty of sensors and radios to boot. Under the hood, there&#8217;s Bluetooth and NFC, not to mention GPS, an accelerometer, a digital compass and a gyroscope. All this is paired with a battery that managed to last me around eight hours. Based on other reviews I&#8217;ve seen, the battery seems to last between sevent and nine hours, depending on usage.</p>

<p>This all sounds fantastic, but there&#8217;s a few things that could have been added/improved as well. First, since there&#8217;s a lack of a rear camera, no camera app has been included. This is most certainly not a deal breaker, but it&#8217;s worth noting, if you&#8217;re into self portraits. There&#8217;s also no HDMI/MHL output, nor a MicroSD slot. The only other gripe that I have is that the speakers are fairly inadiquite, so you&#8217;ll be reaching for your headphones.</p>

<p>The Nexus 7 is a great deal for a tablet that costs just under $200. It has a great display, smooth performance and all the bells and whistles of Jelly Bean. In my opinion, this is the best Android tablet available.</p>

<p>And for the first time, I&#8217;m actually excited about using a tablet.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, if you were wondering: I did preorder Project Glass.</p>

<p><img src="http://michaelevans.org/images/2012/06/26/window.JPG" width="700" height="200" title="Giant Google Banner" ></p>

<p>My guess is that there will be a Nexus tablet (see the Nexus banner on the third floor), with NFC and Google Wallet, and then attendees will get to test the tap-to-pay out at the Google Wallet sponsored Google Store.</p>

    <link href="http://michaelevans.org/blog/2012/06/19/microsoft-surface-has-microsoft-nailed-it/"/>
    <updated>2012-06-19T19:44:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://michaelevans.org/blog/2012/06/19/microsoft-surface-has-microsoft-nailed-it</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night Microsoft unveiled Surface, its entry into the already crowded tablet arena. The name, you might be thinking, sounds awfully familiar. That&#8217;s cause <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PixelSense">it is</a>. Anyway, the hardware of this reincarnation is <em>not</em> a table, it&#8217;s actually quite sleek.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<p>It&#8217;s thinner and lighter than an iPad, and has a built in kickstand. But here&#8217;s the kicker, the &#8220;smart cover&#8221;, doubles as a keyboard. Combine this with Microsoft Office, and I think you might have a competitor in the works. It has a stylus that can work even when your hand is on the screen, a USB port, and all the bells and whistles you&#8217;d want to see from a mobile machine.</p>

<p><img src="http://michaelevans.org/images/2012/06/19/surface.jpeg" width="700" height="400" title="Microsoft Surface" ></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t end the article there. Despite the fact that Microsoft blew me away by revealing a hot tablet, they still might let us down anyway. They were unable to provide a concrete release date, pricing, or battery life. Those three factors could easily change this purchase from a must-have, to a don&#8217;t-bother.</p>

<p>And then there&#8217;s the name. You&#8217;d <strong>think</strong> they&#8217;d call it Microsoft Surface/Surface Pro, or something along those lines. It&#8217;s a popular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Macbook">naming scheme</a> used by a few <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/">other companies</a>, and even in their own <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/compare">product lines</a>. But alas, they went with the succinct &#8220;Surface for Windows 8 Pro.&#8221; Rolls right off the tongue, right?</p>

<p>All in all, I&#8217;m still impressed with what I saw yesterday. The form factor is good, and the potential is there. And when Microsoft takes the hardware and software into their own hands, the usually do a <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/">good</a> <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Kinect">job</a>. Hopefully when it comes out in the fall, Microsoft won&#8217;t let us down.</p>

    <link href="http://michaelevans.org/blog/2012/06/11/wwdc-recap/"/>
    <updated>2012-06-11T21:55:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://michaelevans.org/blog/2012/06/11/wwdc-recap</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you remember from <a href="http://michaelevans.org/blog/2012/06/07/my-wwdc-2012-predictions/">last week</a>, I made some predictions about what Apple would reveal today at WWDC. Let&#8217;s recap what actually happened, and we can see the hits and misses.</p>

<h3>New Macs</h3>

<p>Yep. Refresh for the Air and Pro lines, and the introduction of the &#8220;Super Pro&#8221;. Yeah, I was wrong about the &#8220;Retina&#8221; all around, and nothing for the Mac Mini, but I&#8217;d say I was pretty darn close. There was technically an update for the Mac Pro, but as Marco from Instapaper <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/06/11/half-assed-mac-pro">points out</a>, they basically didn&#8217;t do Pro owners any favors.</p>

<h3>Mountain Lion</h3>

<p>Got a release <em>month</em> (July). There was iCloud Tabs, and a few other iOS features (Notification Center, iMessage, etc.) coming to the desktop.</p>

<h3>iOS 6</h3>

<p>I was a bit disappointed. Nothing I saw made me feel like I needed to have the newest update, since most of the new features are already present in the competitor&#8217;s latest offering, Ice Cream Sandwich. Can&#8217;t wait to see how Google strikes back in two weeks.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<h3>Retina Displays</h3>

<p>I can&#8217;t wait to see it, but at the same time, I don&#8217;t want to. I know that I&#8217;ll love it, and it will make me want one and get rid of my current Macbook Air. So if you own one, please don&#8217;t show me.</p>

<h3>New Maps</h3>

<p>Yawn. Android users have had the same basic experience for maybe two years now.</p>

<h3>Siri Update</h3>

<p>Almost there. They added some more third party support, but it&#8217;s not yet at that API level where I think it will really shine. Maybe in iOS 7?</p>

<h3>Apple TV Update</h3>

<p>Nothing, called that one.</p>

<h3>Facebook Integration</h3>

<p>Still don&#8217;t care.</p>

<p>Yeah, I got the &#8220;Won&#8217;t happen stuff&#8221; right too (Did anyone <em>really</em> think there would be a iPad Mini?).</p>

<p>All in all, I was actually kind of let down. Nothing in Mountain Lion or iOS 6 really makes me get that &#8220;gotta have it&#8221; feeling that iOS 5, or even Lion had. I really was hoping for a Retina Macbook Air (which I&#8217;m guessing will come with the next refresh as Apple drives prices of displays down), but I didn&#8217;t even see hardware (minus the Superbook Pro, which costs way more than I want to pay), that made me feel jealous because I still had the current stuff. Maybe my expectations were too high. I&#8217;m still way more excited for Google IO, since I really don&#8217;t have any concrete idea what we&#8217;ll be seeing. Project Glass anyone?</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[My WWDC 2012 Predictions]]></title>
    <link href="http://michaelevans.org/blog/2012/06/07/my-wwdc-2012-predictions/"/>
    <updated>2012-06-07T18:02:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://michaelevans.org/blog/2012/06/07/my-wwdc-2012-predictions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since essentially all other tech blogs are writing about their predictions for Apple&#8217;s Worldwide Developer Conference which is being held next week, I&#8217;ve decided to throw my guesses into the ring, so we can go over them next week, and see how I did. I&#8217;ll try to touch on all the big rumors that are going around, but if I miss one, feel free to mention it in the comments.</p>

<h2>Things that I think are likely/definite:</h2>

<h3>New Macs</h3>

<p>As any techy will tell you, Intel has shipped some new generation CPU&#8217;s recently (referred to as Ivy Bridge), which would be natural fits for the aging Macbook Pros, as well as the Macbook Airs, iMacs, and even the Mini/Pro. This would also confirm another rumor that&#8217;s going around regarding USB 3.0, since the Ivy Bridge CPUs ship with USB 3.0 support. It&#8217;s also believeable that there will be a new Mac Pro too.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<h3>Mountain Lion</h3>

<p>Since WWDC really is a developer conference, I think it&#8217;s pretty likely that Apple will be setting a release date for it&#8217;s newest operating system release. There&#8217;s not too much else to say about this one, since Apple has already had a small annoucement for it, and there&#8217;s also a good bit of information on their <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/">website</a>. There&#8217;s rumors about &#8220;iCloud Tabs&#8221;, essentially browser tab sync between iOS and OS X, which also seems feasable, since Google has already done this with Chrome.</p>

<h3>iOS 6 Unveiling</h3>

<p>Again, this is a developer conference, and Apple has no better time to demo all their fancy new APIs and features than now. Apple has used WWDC as a time to show off previous versions of iOS, it only seems logical we&#8217;ll get a taste of the new bits next week.</p>

<h3>Retina Displays</h3>

<p>Probably could have grouped this with the new Macs, but I figured the displays deserved their own section. Just as with the iPad, the interface will look the same, but the screen will be far crisper. I think this is huge, not just for Mac users, but to pressure other manufacturers to finally up the resolution on their own notebooks. Using a 15&#8221; notebook with a 1366x768 or 1280x800 resolution is a joke. If you don&#8217;t know or aren&#8217;t sure of the difference the retina displays make, go look at an iPhone 3GS, and then a 4 or 4S. You&#8217;ll wonder how we lived like that.</p>

<h3>New Maps for iOS</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m really surprised it took them this long. As far as I know, no other iPhone app that shipped with 1.0 has had as little work since 2007 as Maps. The signs for an upgrade have been all over. First Apple dropped Google Maps in iPhoto for iOS, and then leaked screenshots made their way onto the internet. Anyway, I hope they knock it out of the park. I&#8217;ve been a long time Google Maps user, and having turn by turn directions and a first class maps app was one of my favorite Android features. After Google&#8217;s update for Google Maps on Wednesday, Apple certainly has their work cut out for them.</p>

<h2>Things that I think are possible</h2>

<h3>Siri Update</h3>

<p>Something that would make me want to use Siri! I have owned an iPhone 4S since shortly after launch, and I have never felt the need to talk to her. Opening up Siri to at least <em>some</em> third parties could go a long way. Yeah, they might even let iPad users in on the &#8220;fun&#8221;.</p>

<h3>Apple TV Update</h3>

<p>Well, the Apple TV rumor is that there will be some sort of App Store for the ATV. I&#8217;m not sold on it. Yeah, it would probably sell Apple TVs like hotcakes, but even as the owner of a Google TV, I really don&#8217;t see the draw to having too many apps on my TV. I guess I could be convinced otherwise with some well-polished software, but I just don&#8217;t see it happening right now.</p>

<h3>Facebook Integration</h3>

<p>Meh. Might happen, might not. Don&#8217;t really feel too strongly either way.</p>

<!--##Things I think are unlikely-->


<h2>Things that won&#8217;t be happening</h2>

<h3>iPhone 5</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s get this one out of the way right now. It ain&#8217;t happening. My bet is that it will ship in the fall, along with the release of iOS 6.</p>

<h3>Apple&#8217;s own TV</h3>

<p>Yeah, right.</p>

<h3>iPad Mini/iPad 7</h3>

<p>Hahahahaha.</p>

<p>Oh you weren&#8217;t kidding? Nope.</p>

<p>Well, that&#8217;s all I have for now. If I&#8217;m missing something, or you have different opinions, feel free to leave a comment! Unfortunately I won&#8217;t be attending WWDC this year, but I <em>will</em> be attending Google IO later this month. So if people find this article interesting, I&#8217;ll do another one before that, and I&#8217;ll also do some live blogging from the conference.</p>

    <link href="http://michaelevans.org/blog/2012/06/05/the-raspberry-pi-has-arrived/"/>
    <updated>2012-06-05T20:08:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://michaelevans.org/blog/2012/06/05/the-raspberry-pi-has-arrived</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As the title suggests, I just received my <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a> (Model B) in the mail. For those who don&#8217;t know about the Raspberry Pi, it&#8217;s a small little computer with 256MB of RAM, a 700MHz CPU and a GPU capable of 1080p output over HDMI. Connectivity is provided via 2 USB 2.0 ports, and a RJ45 10/100 Ethernet port. There&#8217;s HDMI and RCA video, and a 3.5mm jack for audio. Lastly, there&#8217;s an SD slot on the bottom for storage, and the device is powered by a microUSB port, the same one as most smartphones.</p>

<p><img src="http://michaelevans.org/images/2012/06/05/raspberrypi.jpg" width="700" height="200" title="Pi Box" ></p>

<p>I have to say, despite looking at pictures, and seeing information about the Pi on the web, I&#8217;m still surprised how small this thing is. It&#8217;s so small that the box that it comes in looks like a deck of playing cards:</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://michaelevans.org/images/2012/06/05/box.jpg" width="200" height="100" title="Pi Box" ></p>

<p>I decided to go with the <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> image, not only because I&#8217;m familiar with it, but also because that is the suggested distro in the documentation. I&#8217;m considering switching to Arch after I fiddle around with it a little bit more.  After quickly running to pick up an SD card, I hastily plugged in the Pi to my home network, and plugged in the power. A few seconds later, and I was up and running. I logged in and tried the default setup of LXDE (pictured below), and I have to say, it&#8217;s a little sluggish. I tried out some of the included apps, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midori_(web_browser)">Midori</a> (the default browser), and a few of the included development tools.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://michaelevans.org/images/2012/06/05/it_lives.jpg" width="400" height="200" title="Pi Box" ></p>

<p>While the CPU is a little on the slow side, the GPU performance looks impressive. It plays 1080p content with no trouble, and I&#8217;m going to try streaming some video from my NAS later. Others on the internet have reported no issues with that so far.</p>

<p>Anyway, I still haven&#8217;t figured out what I&#8217;m going to do with it yet, but it is a pretty fun little machine. I am investigating options for cases, since I also don&#8217;t really have a good place for it yet. I was looking at <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/model/486999/">this one</a> on Shapeways, but then the case would cost more than the computer itself! The Raspberry Pi foundation appears to be working on something though.</p>

<h6>Small Computer, Huge Screen</h6>

<p><img src="http://michaelevans.org/images/2012/06/05/lxde.jpg" width="700" height="200" title="Pi Box" ></p>

<p>Is it worth the $35? Yeah, I think so. Maybe not to the average person, since it&#8217;s pretty underpowered for things like web browsing. The community around this thing seems huge (and probably will grow as more are shipped) which makes me feel there will be more in store for it. At this price, it&#8217;s slightly more expensive than an <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, and a lot more versatile (at least from a software perspective).</p>

    <updated>2012-06-03T13:09:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://michaelevans.org/blog/2012/06/03/everyone-should-learn-to-program</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was reading a post the other day which was written as a response to Jeff Atwood&#8217;s seemly controversial <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html">blog entry</a>, entitled &#8220;Please don&#8217;t learn to code&#8221;. The part that struck me the most is quoted here:</p>

<blockquote><p>We learn new things because our perception of the world is shaped by our mental catalogues of what is possible and what it useful. We constantly filtering out perceptual noise on the criterion that it doesn&#8217;t help us achieve some goal or end. Just think of when you learn a new word. You suddenly hear it everywhere. Not because everyone else just learned it too, but because you had been filtering it out. It didn&#8217;t help you get around because you didn&#8217;t know how to use it.</p><p>If you don&#8217;t know how to program, you filter out all parts of the world that involve programming. You miss the loops and divide-and-conquers of everyday life. You cannot recognize programming problems without the understanding that outlines these problems against the noise of useless or random information.</p></blockquote>
